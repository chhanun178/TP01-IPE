# TP01-IPE

'Introduction to Programming Environment' is a subject that helps students to build a professional environment for coding and understanding some technical words used in everyday project development. We believe develpment must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. IPE takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as:

- code sharing for group project development.
- code versioning for keeping changes under control.
- code ownership by identifying who makes any part of the code.
- Task management for dividing tasks for each team member.

## Code of Conduct

In order to ensure that everyone understand the subject, make sure everyone complete every 'Task Practice'.
